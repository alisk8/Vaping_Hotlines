# Vaping Killers

## Inspiration
After seeing people around the world, even teenagers, engaging in vaping, we were inspired to create Vape Killers. Vaping, at first, may appear to be a minor issue but it holds mortal consequences and is highly damaging to the person consuming it. It is important for us to take initiative and spread awareness about this issue, making it as public as possible. It is our responsibility to help those in need, who have been sucked in by this horrendous addiction and want to get out. It is our job to help humankind get rid of this concern. 

## What it does
**Hotlines**: Talk to experts and other people who are experiencing the same problem as you from all around the world. Talk to them about vaping, learning more about it and how companies try to rope in people using cool flavors and outer cover designs. 

**Implementation**: You can complete challenges to stay healthy and keep your mind off of vaping, lowering risks of vaping.

**How to?**: Read articles , watch videos and contact numbers about vaping to learn more about how vaping affects you and others around you. 

## How we built it
We built Vape Killers using advanced HTML, CSS, and JS. 

Using advanced CSS, we made sure that the **website's UI** extremely easy to use and pleasing to look at. The background image, being a GIF, was perfectly inducted into the background also using CSS. 

The **Implementation** feature, in JS, uses an array of challenges and randomly generates a challenge for the user to complete. This feature also makes use of the Math Library in JS. On completion of a challenge, the user is congratulated and reinforced to continue completing challenges and moving away from vaping.

The **How to?** feature of the website was built by incorporating carefully selected articles, videos, and contacts that the user may use to better understand the vaping addiction and truly learn about vaping. We did so by using HTML and enhanced CSS. 

The **Hotlines** feature is built using advanced JS and CSS that access your camera and provide you with a great user interface so you can talk to other people and share your experiences. 

**How we would like the Hotlines feature to be built**: Using JS, we want to turn the Hotline feature from just being hardcoded to dynamic so that the website is actually able to pair you up with other live users randomly. We would also, using JS, access people's microphones so audio is transferred. 


## Challenges we ran into
Due to time constraints and the feature being complex and highly time consuming, we were not able to perfect our hotline feature. For now, the Hotline feature is hardcoded into the website, but we will be making this feature fully dynamic after the time period of the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to build a project of such caliber while learning from each other and helping the community is our biggest achievement that we are proud of. 

## What we learned
We learned how to build a professional and easy to use interface while also making the UI pleasing to the eye. We learned how to collaborate in a group and combine our skills to build a website that benefits the community. 

## What's next for Vape Killers
We would really like to complete our Hotline feature so that it fulfills it's purpose and then publicize this website as much as we can so the community is able to take benefit from it. Our purpose is to get the website out to as many people as we can so we can save lives and help people withdraw from their addictions. We would also like to expand the purpose from just vape to smoking, alcoholism, etc.
